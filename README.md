Round 1B 2010
Problem C. Your Rank is Pure
https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/635101/dashboard#s=p2&a=2

The game can be played on any subset S of positive integers. A number in S is considered pure with respect to S if, starting from it, you can continue taking its rank in S, and get a number that is also in S, until in finite steps you hit the number 1, which is not in S.
When n is given, in how many ways you can pick S, a subset of {2, 3, ..., n}, so that n is pure, with respect to S? The answer might be a big number, you need to output it modulo 100003.
SOLUTION : PurePrime

Round 1A 2017
Problem A. CakeInitials - 
https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/5304486/dashboard

You are catering a party for some children, and you are serving them a cake in the shape of a grid with R rows and C columns. Your assistant has started to decorate the cake by writing every child's initial in icing on exactly one cell of the cake. Each cell contains at most one initial, and since no two children share the same initial, no initial appears more than once on the cake.

Each child wants a single rectangular (grid-aligned) piece of cake that has their initial and no other child's initial(s). Can you find a way to assign every blank cell of the cake to one child, such that this goal is accomplished? It is guaranteed that this is always possible. There is no need to split the cake evenly among the children, and one or more of them may even get a 1-by-1 piece; this will be a valuable life lesson about unfairness.

Tatiana likes to keep things tidy. Her toys are sorted from smallest to largest, her pencils are sorted from shortest to longest and her computers from oldest to newest. One day, when practicing her counting skills, she noticed that some integers, when written in base 10 with no leading zeroes, have their digits sorted in non-decreasing order. Some examples of this are 8, 123, 555, and 224488. She decided to call these numbers tidy. Numbers that do not have this property, like 20, 321, 495 and 999990, are not tidy.

She just finished counting all positive integers in ascending order from 1 to N. What was the last tidy number she counted?
